Call to order, and don\u0026rsquo;t forget to choose your blades!\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Blue Ripper Miter Master Rail Saw is the easiest, simplest way to create a perfect miter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis is the saw you want if you are mitering standard stone slabs, prefabs, or large format porcelain tile slabs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePrice does \u003cstrong\u003eNOT\u003c/strong\u003e include rails.

The only exception is if you are cutting very soft material like marble, travertine, or limestone - in these materials a vacuum brazed or electroplated blade, again with side protection, is what we recommend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBlade choice is critical in determining your cut speed, edge chip, and life. We\u0026rsquo;ve selected what we think are pretty exceptional blades for the task, however everyone has their own preference so feel free to experiment - just make sure the blade has the side protection!\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRecommended Blades\n4 inch blade for porcelain tile (2pcs 788-289)\n5 inch blade for 2cm granite (2pcs 206-053)\n5 inch blade for 3cm marble/travertine/limestone (2pcs 214-220)\n6 inch blade for 3cm granite (2pcs 140-563)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePlease inform sales of your blade choice upon purchase of the Blue Ripper Miter Master™.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"requires-blue-ripper-rails\"\u003eRequires Blue Ripper Rails™\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThese rails are designed for all Blue Ripper™ branded machines made by Omega Diamond.

They have diamonds arrayed in a specific pattern in each segment (see the Image Gallery below for a detail of this pattern). A big advantage with arrayed technology is that the outer edge wears flat or even concave, this (non rounding edge) keeps the blades tracking truer so they don\u0026rsquo;t cut right or left as they wear like traditional blades can. The evenly balanced cutting action provides a fast, smooth cut; and because the patterned diamonds are exposed to the stone at the same consistent rate as all the other diamonds in each segment, the blade life is greatly extended - 30% longer blade-life than traditional blades.
