Omega Diamond provides a Limited Warranty to specific tool models, given below, manufactured by Omega Diamond. Below you can find the details about your warranty written in plain English for ease of understanding.  Please note that this warranty is subject to change without notice; this page, and/or specific linked pages given below, represent the current terms of the warranty for the item you purchased.

As this warranty is simply a written statement of our longstanding practice, it applies retroactively to all currently warranted customers.


## Scope of warranty

All covered models are warranted solely against defects in the workmanship and materials for the duration of the warranty.  This means that wear-and-tear, abuse, misuse, etc. are not covered by the warranty.  Things that are covered would be if a part is made outside of our internally documented specifications and thus causes a problem in the normal use of the item.  In order to make sure of the problem, and to allow us to find and correct the source of the defect, we require that all warranty repairs be evaluated by Omega Diamond personnel at our factory.  This may mean that your tool, or the relevant part, needs to be shipped to our facility for inspection and correction.

This warranty only applies to new purchases, and only to the original end-user purchaser; it cannot be transferred to any other person or business.  Previously owned, replacement, or repair items may not be covered under any warranty.

This warranty also does not cover malfunctions, failures, or defects resulting from misuse, abuse, neglect, accident, unauthorized alteration, or lack of proper maintenance. This warranty also does not cover modifications or repairs performed, or any consequent damage, by entities other than those authorized by Omega Diamond.

This warranty also does not cover consequential damages: Omega Diamond cannot be held responsible for downtime or other expenses incurred by the failure, whether for a defect or otherwise, of any of our products.

This warranty is void if the item in question shows signs of abuse or that the tool has not been maintained according to the instructions attached to the tool or the instruction manual published on this site and/or shipped with item.  


### Customers outside of the United States

Due to limits set by border customs on used equipment, we cannot supply any warranty to customers outside of the United States.  Your local distributor may have different options and may be able to help you.  We can ship you new parts at retail price, but free factory warranty service and free shipping are explicitly excluded.


## Warranty repair service

We require that all customers call us directly before packaging and shipping their tools to us for repair.  This allows us the ability to pre-diagnose the problem and possibly minimize your downtime by providing an in-field fix you can do yourself. It also gives us the chance to advise proper packaging and shipping liability value. While we want to provide all the help we can, we only cover defects in workmanship and materials, as stipulated above.  However, our technicians are willing and able to give advice on how to correct or avoid premature or repeated failures.

Please pack the tool in the original or equivalent packaging, being sure to detach all bits and blades.  Omega Diamond is not responsible for damages incurred during the shipment process. But we will work with the shipper if damage occurred to an item that was properly packaged.  

Be sure to place a legible note in the packaging with your name, the company name, and a phone number we can use to contact you.  If you don't there's a chance your tool will eventually fall under the Abandonment clause below, and no-one wants that to happen!

Also be sure to clean the tool as well as possible: you may be charged for any extra time we have to take to scrape off all the accumulated grime. Cleaning is not covered under our warranty services!

If we find that the damaged or failed part has resulted from misuse, abuse, neglect, accident, alteration, lack of proper maintenance, or modification/repair performed by an entity other than those authorized by Omega Diamond, you will need to pay for replacement parts, labor charges, and total freight charges.

During the time of the warranty we provide free ground shipping to and from our factory, subject to the above exclusion for factory repairs for out-of-country customers.  Customers will be responsible for the extra cost of shipping faster than ground.


## Lifetime repair and upgrade services

As a service to our customers, we provide lifetime repair, subject to part availability, and telephone tech support for all of our customers.  The requirements are practically the same as for the warranty repair service, with the change that you are covering shipping both ways and the cost of parts and labor.  To keep ourselves honest and as transparent as possible, we will first evaluate and estimate the cost of the repair and ask your permission to continue.  Once we've got permission and the repair is done, we will then send you the bill and, after we've received payment, ship the tool back to you.

Be sure to clean the tool as well as possible: you may be charged for any extra time we have to take to scrape off all the accumulated grime. You will be charged for the extra time it takes us to clean the tool so that it can be analyzed and/or repaired.

Please note that a non-refundable fee of $75 US will be charged to investigate and process a repair.  The $75 US nonrefundable fee must be paid in advance and is in addition to the actual cost of repair.  

We operate on a continuous improvement model: we are always looking for and finding better ways to make our tools.  This means that at times we will change certain assemblies and parts in ways that are not always backward compatible.  That said, we will always try to develop an upgrade path such that only a few more parts might need replacement to get your tool back in operation.  We are always available to guide or give you pointers over the phone so you can do some upgrades yourself!

## Common warranty period

All items listed under the warranty period section are also covered by a 30 day refund, subject to a 15% restocking fee.  If there is damage or signs of use, damage and/or usage fees may apply.  Shipping and freight charges are nonrefundable.  Refunds will be for store credit only - no cash refunds.

Replacement parts, unless explicitly listed in the Warranty period section above, are not covered by warranty from Omega Diamond.  If there is a warranty on the item from a 3rd party, please contact the 3rd party for warranty service or replacement.


## Motor exclusions

Any model of our tools that uses an off-the-shelf saw or grinder explicitly excludes that part from the warranty.  Those 3rd party companies who manufacture those saws and grinders are responsible for their own warranties, if they so choose to supply or honor such.  This includes every part supplied by those companies that is used on our equipment, including but not limited to the motor, gearbox, and housings.


## Abandonment

If we have your tool for over a period of sixty (60) days and are unable to reach you during that time to authorize the repair process or get payment, or if we receive a tool with no way to identify the owner and it sits for sixty (60) days  at our facility, the tool will be considered abandoned and will be claimed as the property of Omega Diamond.  After that point, you will have no further rights to the thus “abandoned tool”.

Make sure this doesn't happen to you!  Put your contact info in the box, call us, answer our calls, do whatever it takes!


## Custom work

All custom work, including but not limited to abrasive tooling, blanks, power tools, and equipment, are subject to a minimum 50% deposit in order to process the order.  Such orders are non-cancellable and deposits are non-refundable.


## Governing Law

Very, very rarely someone is unhappy with the benefits the above gives them.  This clause is to specify how these disputes are settled.

All of the rights and duties of the parties arising from or relating in any way to the subject matter of this warranty shall be governed, construed, and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State and County of the headquarters of the Manufacturer, without regard to its conflict of laws rules, excepting those conflict of laws rules that govern this clause.

Customer unconditionally agrees that in case of dispute between parties, that Jurisdiction shall be in the State and County of the headquarters of the Manufacturer.
