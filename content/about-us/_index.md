## About Us

We started this tool company in 1989 mostly as a R&D lab, for developing better diamond tools.
We incorporated as Omega Diamond, Inc. in 1999 and have since grown to be an internationally recognized manufacturer of quality diamond tooling and power tools.

With personal experience manufacturing diamond tools since 1985, we are able to get the job done fast and easy. Our in-house Machine Shop, Manufacturing Facility and excellent hard working employees, allows us to go from R&D testing to production faster than most other facilities.

Originally founded to produce diamond tooling for the ultra precise semiconductor and optics industry, we have since expanded into the stone industry. Since then we have produced amazing hand tools like our famous Blue Ripper Rail Saw Series and our strong Red Ripper Router and the best stone shear on the market.

It is our wish, and the wish of all our employees, that we can provide valuable and time saving information along with good quality tools and machines. Our continuing endeavor is to provide innovative tools and machines for you.

Please, come and visit us at any of our facilities.

Sam Devai,
CEO, Omega Diamond, Inc.
