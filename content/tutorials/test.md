## Introduction
In some environments static electricity can push the string away from the rail, so it is critical that you wrap around and have string on both sides of a single rail bar and check the difference in the gap: if both sides show the same amount of gap, no matter how much that gap actually is, the rail is straight.

## Step 1

* Set the ends of the rail on 4x4 wood blocks with the bend set curved up in the middle.

## Step 2

* (If the aluminum angle is facing down, set the rail so that the edge of the angle aluminum hangs off the edge of the wood block.)

* Make sure both ends are stable on the blocks.

## Step 4

* Using some sort of support to hold yourself steady, step down on the rail providing just enough force to bend the rail straight.


## Notes
Remember, don't loosen the bolts too much or the saw will be too loose and it will be hard to be accurate.

Also, do not remove the indicator from the blade until the motor is in alignment.

Note that the indicator shown in the pictures is a customized indicator used here at the factory. That said, the indicator linked to above will work fine for the task and was what we used until we made this unit. If you are aligning a lot of saws, feel free to call us, and we can quote you a price on a customized magnetic indicator.
