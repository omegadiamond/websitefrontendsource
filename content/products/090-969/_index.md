The Blue Ripper Miter Master™ Rail Saw creates a perfectly mitered edge by cutting both 45 degree angles simultaneously. The Blue Ripper Miter Master™ comes with two free blades. Call to order, and don't forget to choose your blades!

The Blue Ripper Miter Master Rail Saw is the easiest, simplest way to create a perfect miter.

This is the saw you want if you are mitering standard stone slabs, prefabs, or large format porcelain tile slabs.

Price does **NOT** include rails. Blue Ripper Rails sold separately. For info about ordering a saw with rails see Notes below.


## Tips & Tricks
We suggest that you use 5 inch blades with these machines if you are cutting 2cm stone. 6 inch blades are suggested for 3cm stone as the 5 inch will tend to leave a lip at the bottom of the cut on some 3cm stone, especially when the blade wears.  

The best blades for this tool are blades manufactured with metal-bond side protection. The only exception is if you are cutting very soft material like marble, travertine, or limestone - in these materials a vacuum brazed or electroplated blade, again with side protection, is what we recommend.

Blade choice is critical in determining your cut speed, edge chip, and life. We've selected what we think are pretty exceptional blades for the task, however everyone has their own preference so feel free to experiment - just make sure the blade has the side protection!

Recommended Blades
4 inch blade for porcelain tile (2pcs 788-289)
5 inch blade for 2cm granite (2pcs 206-053)
5 inch blade for 3cm marble/travertine/limestone (2pcs 214-220)
6 inch blade for 3cm granite (2pcs 140-563)

Please inform sales of your blade choice upon purchase of the Blue Ripper Miter Master™.

## Requires Blue Ripper Rails™
These rails are designed for all Blue Ripper™ branded machines made by Omega Diamond. You can set up the Blue Ripper Rail™ on a slab and cut with either the Blue Ripper Sr™ or the Blue Ripper Jr™, then move the rail and switch out for the Blue Ripper Miter Master™ to cut the perfect mitered edge all on the same rail!
The Blue Ripper Rails™ are sold separately and DO NOT come with the Blue Ripper™ machines unless specifically ordered (see Notes below). Please see the Blue Ripper Rails™ page for rail options.
