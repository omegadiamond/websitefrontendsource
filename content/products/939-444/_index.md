The Lockness™ Vacuum Clamp is another in our lineup of extremely versatile tools.  With its strong 9" stone-grade suction cup, far superior to the plate-glass grade cups often found on the market, the suction cup provides a stronger lockdown for longer.

## Use Cases

The most common use of the Lockness™ Vacuum Clamp is to lock down the Blue Ripper Rail in situations where a C-clamp can't fit.  However, it has many more opportunities for use:

* Preventing a sink-cutout from crashing to the floor
* Leveling seams
* Carrying slab
* Carrying a full-size backsplash
* And many more possible uses!

Note that some of the use-cases may require more than one clamp.
