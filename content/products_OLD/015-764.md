The Red Ripper Ultralight™ Stone Router is our lightest router yet! Weighing in at only 11 lbs, you can easily pick up this router with one hand! It is built for profiling sinks and edges, and is perfect for pre-fabs. The built-in hydroplaning base helps the router move smoothly over the surface of the stone without scratching. Works on both natural and engineered stone. While the router is light, it is no lightweight when it comes to the size of bits it can use - almost all standard 7/8 bore with M10-1.5 bolt router bits will fit and be usable, including all common 2, 3, and 4cm bits.  We've even seen guys swing larger bits, but that can cause the machine to become unbalanced, requiring a weight in the back to level things back out again!

Whether you are looking to start up a shop, or whether you just want your team to have an in-expensive router that they can keep on-hand at all times or even take to the job site, the Red Ripper Ultralight™ Stone Router is for you.

## Notes

Product may show minor usage (dust, etc.) due to factory testing when shipped.

Product may not precisely match images. We are constantly working on each of our products to find better designs, and we ship each new machine with the best design we have at that time.
