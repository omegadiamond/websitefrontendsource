I wanted to tell Sam thanks again for spending so much time with us at the [2013] stone expo in Vegas. We are a very small granite company and we went to the expo to purchase Fab King to cut out sinks. After looking at the Fab King we were left scratching our heads wondering what to do, or buy in our price range. We checked out the Omega booth because we have a Blue Ripper Sr. After talking with Sam, he [showed] us the Red Ripper Ultralight - it's EXACTLY what we needed!!!!

*Thank you very much for the help!!!!*
