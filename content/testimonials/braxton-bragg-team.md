The Braxton-Bragg team went to Heartland Cabinet And Granite Factory Outlet to their Newport, TN stone fabrication shop. They found a fabricator who is a fervent supporter of the Blue Ripper Sr Rail Saw!

In this video, Mike - a fabricator with 5 years of experience - tells Braxton-Bragg why he prefers using the Blue Ripper Sr Rail Saw to using a bridge saw or a CNC machine.
